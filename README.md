# 30-DAYS-CPP-OOPS-STL-PRACTICE

Hi, I'm Yash Kumar Singh, a 2nd-year Chemical Engineering undergrad from NIT Durgapur (2024–2028).

Welcome to the 30-Day C++ OOPs + STL Ladder — a structured problem set designed to help you deeply understand the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) and Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. This ladder progresses from easy to medium to conceptually strong problems to ensure steady growth.


---

🚀 Goals

Master OOP concepts in C++ including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

Get hands-on with STL containers like vector, map, set, stack, queue, priority queue, and algorithms.

Apply C++ concepts to design mini systems and solve real-world inspired problems.

Build confidence for interviews and problem-solving scenarios.

📌 Topics Covered

OOPs Concepts

Classes & Objects

Constructors & Destructors

Inheritance (Single, Multi-level)

Access Specifiers: Public, Private, Protected

Polymorphism (Function Overloading & Overriding)

Virtual Functions & Abstract Classes

Static Members

Operator Overloading

Templates (Generic Programming)

Composition & Encapsulation


STL Components

vector, pair, map, set, stack, queue, priority_queue, deque, list

Sorting with custom comparators

Unordered map and custom hash functions
